Good JSON parsers in typed languages usually do this automatically.",

As a Merlin employee, he rose quickly up the ranks and by 2019 he was one of the company’s leading creatives. That year, the CEO, Nick Varney, decided to demolish an old log flume at Thorpe Park, a Merlin resort near the M25 in Surrey, and to put something more attention-grabbing in its place. Burton was given the project to look after. He had just the one instruction from his bosses, to raise up a rollercoaster to a height of 213ft or more at its peak, which would make it Britain’s tallest: something that could be boasted about in future marketing materials. He knew that whatever he created might end up being a referendum on his youthful hiring and his rapid elevation. “I was relatively new,” he said, “and this was their biggest ever investment in a ride.”",

Burton was handed the project with one clear directive: build a rollercoaster that was at least 213 feet tall. This would make it Britain's tallest and give them a great marketing story.
